# Simple PV Analyzer

Simple PV Analyzer is a web application designed to quickly estimate photovoltaic (PV) generation for new project sites. Built with Next.js, it provides a user-friendly interface for solar energy professionals to assess potential solar installations rapidly.

## Why I Built This App

As a solar energy professional, I often needed a quick way to estimate PV generation for potential project sites. This app streamlines that process, allowing for rapid assessment of solar energy potential across various locations. It's an invaluable tool for initial project evaluations and client discussions.

## Features

- **Quick Estimation**: Get PV generation estimates in seconds
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use input forms and clear results display
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust system specifications for accurate estimates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use the App

1. **Enter Location**: Input the project site's geographical details
2. **Specify System**: Set the PV system parameters (panel type, array size, etc.)
3. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze" button to calculate estimates
4. **Review Results**: Examine the daily and annual energy production projections
